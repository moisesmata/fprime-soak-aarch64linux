"""soak_integration_tests.py:

Integration tests for SoakDeployment using the standard F' integration test pattern.
These tests follow the same structure as LED blinker and Ref integration tests.

The fprime_test_api fixture automatically handles:
- Dictionary detection from build artifacts  
- Connection to running FSW/GDS
- Support for --dictionary command line argument

Usage:
  pytest soak_integration_tests.py                           # Auto-detect build artifacts
  pytest --dictionary <path-to-dict> soak_integration_tests.py  # Explicit dictionary
